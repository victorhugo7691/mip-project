    "# Mip Procure Formulation\n",
    "The problem we formulate in this document has the following characteristics:\n",
    "- There are multiple SKUs being ordered from a supplier and shipped to a warehouse;\n",
    "- Inventory of each SKU can be held from one period to the next (there may be inventory at the start of the planning horizon, also known as openning inventory);\n",
    "- SKUs can be stored both at supplier location or at the warehouse;\n",
    "- Per-unit inventory cost is charged for each type of SKU;\n",
    "- There is a minimum quantity (buffer against uncertainty) to be kept in the inventory of each SKU at the warehouse in every period that has demand;\n",
    "- There is a total inventory capacity at both the warehouse and the supplier;\n",
    "- Demand for each SKU is known and must be met every period from the warehouse;\n",
    "- Purchase cost of each SKU is per unit;\n",
    "- There is a minimum order quantity (MOQ), i.e., if a given SKU is purchased in a given period, then at least, let's say, 100 units must be purchased. Similarly, there's a maximum order quantity;\n",
    "- There is a minimum shipment quantity for each SKU, i.e., if a given SKU is shipped from the supplier to the warehouse in a given period, then at least, let's say, 100 units of this SKU must be shipped;\n",
    "- There is an expedition capacity from the supplier, over the number of bags to be shipped per period of all SKUs.\n",
    "- There is a receiving capacity at the warehouse, set over the number of different **types** of SKUs received (not on their transferred quantities themselves!).\n",
    "- There is a maximum number of time periods during which an item can be held in inventory at the supplier (inventory aging)."

    "3. Deliveries from supplier to warehouse take less than 1 period of time, so we can assume that whatever is purchased in a Period $t$ will get to the warehouse in the same period (as there were no lead time)."
